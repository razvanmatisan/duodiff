[![Status](https://github.com/razvanmatisan/early-stopping-diffusion/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/razvanmatisan/early-stopping-diffusion/actions/workflows/python.yml)

## Dev instructions
The first time:
1. Configure a virtual environment
3. Run `pre-commit install`

After that, be sure that all the tests are passing before a commit. Otherwise, GitHub Actions will complain ;) You can check by running
```bash
python -m pytest tests
```
